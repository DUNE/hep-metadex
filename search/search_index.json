It is typically conducted in a workshop setting and allows the stakeholders of a given domain to build a high-level model of its systems and related processes. While many concepts from Domain-Driven Design are used in event storming, it is not a strictly DDD focused technique.</p> <p>Most of the online resources related to event storming will show examples that are business domain oriented.

As a general practice interactions, are time ordered; flowing from left to right, and from top to bottom. The following describes the basic notation used in the design of the ProtoDUNE metadata management process models.</p> <p>Event Storming Notation</p> <p></p> Notation Type Description <code>Bounded Context (Dashed Box)</code> An area of domain language consistency. A way to group all related domain events, entities, and their processes. <code>Actor (Light Yellow)</code> The users that participate in any process; they can be human, or computational. <code>Command (Blue)</code> The execution of an action. <code>Domain Event (Orange)</code> The result of an executed action. Considered the facts of a domain. <code>External System (Pink)</code> External platforms, APIs, sites, etc. <code>Policy (Purple)</code> A process that is called when something happens. <code>Aggregate (Yellow)</code> A top-level entity that encapsulates all of the domain rules, including the child entities involved in command execution. <code>Read Model (Green)</code> Data that needs to fetched from a source; often used to make process decisions. <code>Hotspot (Red)</code> Possible issues or items that we do not yet know how to handle. <code>Comment (Light Grey)</code> A callout indicating something of note."},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#metadata-management-process-models","title":"Metadata Management Process Models","text":""},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#interval-of-validity-iov","title":"Interval of Validity (IOV)","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Interval of Validity Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#run-configuration","title":"Run Configuration","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Run Configuration Process Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#beam-conditions-ifbeam","title":"Beam Conditions (IFBeam)","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Beam Conditions Process Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#slow-controls","title":"Slow Controls","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Slow Controls Process Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#offline-calibration","title":"Offline Calibration","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Calibration Process Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#simulation","title":"Simulation","text":"<p>ProtoDUNE Simulation Metadata Management Process Model</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"protodune-metadex-protodune-metadata-exchange/architecture/event-storming/#data-quality-and-monitoring-dqm","title":"Data Quality and Monitoring (DQM)","text":"<p>(TBD) ProtoDUNE Data Quality and Monitoring Process Model</p>"}]}
